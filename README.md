this link provides the installation steps for downloading mongodb but as of 2020 the installation steps have been changed the latest vers now is mongodb 6.0.

After version 6.0.0 mongo.exe does not get installed to your bin folder so you have to manually install the new MongoDB shell which is called mongosh then you have to
add its path to your system variables and then run mongosh --version to see if it got installed. 

It should be noted, that in MongoDB version 6.0 there are two items:

The legacy mongo shell is removed from MongoDB 6.0

The MongoDB Shell (mongosh) is not installed with MongoDB Server. You need to follow the mongosh installation instructions to download and install mongosh separately. This was already announced in MongoDB version 5.0

The legacy mongo shell does not exist anymore on MongoDB version 6.0. If you desire the old mongo.exe, then you can install if from an earlier MongoDB version.
